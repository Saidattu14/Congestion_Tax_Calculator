# Congestion_Tax_Calculator
 
 For example there is a list of dates like [
       
    "2013-02-13 06:52:00",
    "2013-02-13 07:38:00",
    "2013-02-13 08:28:15",
    "2013-02-13 08:37:00"
  ]
  
  
  In the above case The difference between t1 and t2 is less than an hour and t2 and t3 is also less than an hour.
  My question is how many times we can reuse the maximum congestion tax timing in Single charge rule?
  According tax and timing details t2 has max tax. It can applied in (t2,t3), (t2,t1) and (t2,t3,t4) interval is well when we apply the Single charge rule.
